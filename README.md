BOOK CLUB!

Welcome to The Book Club! Use this website to create a database of books to be shared and read by a group of individual contributors. Users can create, edit, and delete books upon completion, and their entries are only alterable by themselves. Each book entry includes specific information, including the Title, Author, Genre, and a short Blurb about the content of the book. Users may also leave comments on any books anyone has entered into the database.

Installation To install this program, clone the repository from https://github.com/jcmcarth06/rails-book-club, then run 'bundle install' in the terminal.

Usage The user must first create a signup profile that includes a unique email, username, and password. From the signup page, the user wil be automatically be routed to the book list index. On other log in instances, the user will start at the login page. If they enter invalid credentials, they will be redirected to the signup page to create some, which will send them down that same route. From the index page, the user can see a list of all of the books they and other users have added. They can view specific details about each book, including title, author, genre, and a blurb, by clicking on the title. They will also be able to add a new book to the database from the index page which includes all of the aforementioned attributes. When a user is on the view page, they have the option to edit or delete a book from the database, but will only be able to update or delete an instance that they created. Users may also leave comments on books created by other users. The user can also view all of their books and comments from their profile show page. At the top of each page is a home feature, which routes the user to the book list index, a profile feature, a genres indec, and a log out feature, which logs the user out of that session.
